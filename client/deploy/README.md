Deploy client allow users to perform certain operations for VSPERF set-up.

If you would like to upload new T-rex and collectd configuration file user have two choices.

1. User can provide path in vsperfclient.conf file.

2. When running client ask for path use specific path where configuration file exist.

T-rex and collectd configuration file should be saved with trex_cfg.yaml and collectd.conf respectively.

In order to use deploy client, user must have to start server which can we achieve by running deployment/interactive container.

User can run the script with python3.
